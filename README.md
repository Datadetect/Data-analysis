# Data-analysis
These are the the small projects I've finished before. Just for analyzing for training and for fun.
Hi everyone, this is Grace, a UMD Marketing Analytics graduate who enjoys herself the most when doing data analysis. 
The reason I like data analysis is I love detecting. I believe a small thing has big meaning inside it. A number is not just a number. Numbers always give me 'Aha' moment. I can discover the trend, how people think and even know more about myself through data analysis. I hope GitHub can be my playground where I can freely share my thoughts,findings and interests.
